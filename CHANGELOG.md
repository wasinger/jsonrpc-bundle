### v0.7.0-beta 2023-10-24 ###
-   Updated for Symfony 5 and 6 and PHP 8.

### v0.6.0 2017-02-09 ###
-   added compatibility with Symfony 3, thanks to @JasonMiesionczek
-   minimum required Symfony version is now 2.7

### v0.5.0 2014-12-17 ###
-   It is now possible to call methods that require objects as parameters (in previous versions only methods with scalar
    and array parameters could be called). That's why JMSSerializerBundle is now a required dependency.
    For this to work, the following conditions must be met:
    - The method parameters must be correctly type hinted
    - The parameter classes must contain [jms_serializer `@Type` annotations for its properties](http://jmsyst.com/libs/serializer/master/reference/annotations#type)

### v0.4.4 2014-11-28 ###
-   The test service is no longer registered automatically. If you want to use it,
    you must define it in the config.yml of your application, see updated [Resources/doc/index.rst](Resources/doc/index.rst).

### v0.4.2 2014-11-28 ###
-   fixed bug introduced in v0.2.0: named parameters given in associative arrays were always passed to the method in
    the order they were given, not by their names. Thanks to @teet.

### v0.4.1 2014-11-19 ###
-   raised required symfony version to 2.3
-   Added mandatory LICENSE and index.rst files
-   only metadata, no code changes

### v0.4.0 2014-10-23 ###
-   All public methods of services tagged with 'wa72_jsonrpc.exposable' can be called via JSON-RPC. The method name
    to be used in the RPC call is "service:method", i.e. the name of the service and the method separated by colon.
